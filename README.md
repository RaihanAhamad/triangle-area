# Triangle Area ðŸ§®

This is a simple Python script that calculates the area of different types of triangles:

- Right-angled triangle
- Equilateral triangle
- Isosceles triangle
- Scalene triangle (using Heron's formula)

## Usage

Run the script using Python:

```bash
python3 "Triangle Area.py"
```
Follow the prompts to choose the triangle type and enter the required dimensions.

Future Plans
- Add more triangle-related formulas
- Add input validation
- Make a GUI version (maybe ðŸ˜‰)

Feel free to use or modify the code!
